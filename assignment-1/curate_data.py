'''
Now let's load the data in a more manageable format.
Since, depending on your computer setup you might not be able to fit it all in memory,
we'll load each class into a separate dataset, store them on disk and curate them independently.
Later we'll merge them into a single dataset of manageable size.
We'll convert the entire dataset into a 3D array (image index, x, y) of floating point values,
normalized to have approximately zero mean and standard deviation ~0.5 to make training easier down the road.
A few images might not be readable, we'll just skip them.
